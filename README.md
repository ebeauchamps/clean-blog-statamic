The Statamic 2.x version of the Clean Blog theme by ![Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/)
  
A minimalist blog theme based on Bootstrap 3.3.7, suitable for personal or (small) company blogs. It features a blog index, an about page and a working contact page.
  
## What's Included  
  
- placeholder photos in the `assets/img` folder
- dummy content in the `site/content/collections` folder
- some globals in, you know, `site/content/globals`
- fieldsets and formset. This theme is currently using the ![Replicator fieldtype](https://docs.statamic.com/fieldtypes/replicator)
  
## What's NOT included  
  
Statamic app files and the license number associated with them.
So go buy one license, or soon a clown will cry.
