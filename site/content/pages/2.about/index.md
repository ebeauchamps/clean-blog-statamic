<p>Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose.</p>

<p>It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. Let's have a little bit of fun today. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you.</p>

<p>You can create anything that makes you happy. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. Take your time. Speed will come later. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff.</p>
